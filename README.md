## Ebony Tempral

I'm from Jamaica and moved to Canada about 8 years ago. I also lived in New York as a kid for about 3 years. 
I'm a huge food enthusiast - I love cooking, baking and tasting dishes with complex flavour combinations. 
I originally studied Journalism and Communications but realized it wasn't my passion so I changed careers.
I've been enjoying this program so far and looking forward to learning more.

### Top 3 fun facts about me:
1. I've watched The Office and How I Met Your Mother over 10 times.
2. I can do a one-handed cartwheel.
3. I can move my ears.

### Here are some of my hobbies:
- Reading
- Listening to music
- Cooking and baking
- Amateur photography
